## General Information
- Aim of the project was to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes
- Dataset being used is the Bike Sharing dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- I was able to build a multiple linear regression model for predicting shared bike demand with an adjusted r2_score of 0.85 on the train set and r2_score of 0.808 on the test set

## Technologies Used
- python - Anaconda Jupyter notebook, seaborn library for plotting

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by linear regression course taught at Upgrad
